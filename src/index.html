        <h1>Who voted for Article 13?</h1>
        <p>On March 26th Members of the European Parliament voted to pass a new copyright directive. It has become known by the controversial Article 13, which requires online platforms to remove copyrighted material from their websites. Fear of censorship brought thousands of people to the streets protesting to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=SaveTheInternet">#SaveTheInternet</a>. While the bill was intended to give writers and artists more protection of their creative rights, it will mostly benefit big publishers, restrict freedom and creativity for everyone else. Here is an overview of who <span class="voted-for">voted for</span> the law and who <span class="voted-against">voted against</span> it.</p>

        <p>(No amendments) Small and independent content creators are threatened, especially if they rely on publishing their content on big platforms like YouTube. Since the platforms will be responsible for copyright infringements, they'll likely put pre-filters in place to prevent copyrighted material from being published. Such filters are notoriously hard to devise and prone to failure, as YouTube's ContentID proves regularly.</p>

        <h2>Votes by political group</h2>

        <p>Vocal supporters of the new copyright directive are copyright collectives, big music and media organisations. Many of them have a strong lobby in Brussels and close ties to the conservative EPP – the driving force behind the law.</p>
